# Differance between if-else loops in C and Python is that in C we use curly braces {} to define the scope of if-else blocks,whereas in Python we use indentation to define the scope. also in C we use parentheses () to enclose the condition, whereas in Python parentheses are optional unless needed for clarity.and in C we use else if for multiple conditions, whereas in Python we use elif.
