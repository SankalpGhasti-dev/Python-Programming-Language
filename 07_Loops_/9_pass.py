# The pass statement is a null operation; it does nothing when executed. It is used as a placeholder in situations where a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed. In this case, the for loop iterates from 0 to 242, but since the body of the loop contains only the pass statement, no operations are performed during each iteration.
