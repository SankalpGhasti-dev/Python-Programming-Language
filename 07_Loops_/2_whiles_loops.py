# while loop will continue until the condition becomes false.  
# differance between while loops in C and Python is that in C we use curly braces {} to define the scope of while loop,whereas in Python we use indentation to define the scope. also in C we use parentheses () to enclose the condition, whereas in Python parentheses are optional unless needed for clarity.
