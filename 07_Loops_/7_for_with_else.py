l = [1, 7, 8]

for item in l:
    print(item)

else:
    print("done")

# in this code, for loop iterates through each element in the list 'l' and prints it. After the loop completes all iterations, the else block is executed, printing "done". the else block is executed only after the for loop has finished iterating over all elements in the list.
